            <h1><b>About Us</b></h1>
            <p class="py-2"> Love Green Nepal (LGN) is an autonomous, non-governmental development organization (NGO) established in
                1991. It is a legal entity registered (Regd. No. 249/048/49) with Kathmandu District Administrative
                Office of Nepal Government under the Organization Registration Act of 1977. LGN is affiliated
                (Affiliation No. 9149) to the Social Welfare Council a coordinating and umbrella body of NGOs in Nepal.
                It is also registered with Inland Revenue Department, Kathmandu (PAN No.301708975).
            </p>
            <p class="py-2">It is an NGO run collectively by the Nepali nationals with diverse academic as well as professional
                expertise and background ranging from management to community development. LGN members and staffs work
                with a strong commitment towards contributing to upliftment of low income people living in rural
                communities.
            </p>
            <p class="py-2">
                In the beginning, LGN started its projects in Sankhu area of Kathmandu district in 1991. Its initial
                purpose was to develop greenery in the villages of rural Nepal. However, LGN gradually adopted other
                activities like school building construction, biogas plant installation, girl students scholarship, etc.
                and finally started to work in an integrated community development approach.
            </p>
            <p class="py-2"> LGN intends to contribute to creating economically sustainable, environmentally sound and socially
                peaceful and harmonious communities. For this, it strives to promote sustainable model communities which
                fundamentally thrive on utilization of their own internal resources. With this in mind, LGN is making
                efforts to develop sustainable livelihoods for economically disadvantaged people in marginalized
                communities in rural settings.
            </p>
            <p class="py-2">
                At present, LGN is implementing its projects mainly in 2 districts of Nepal namely Kavrepalanchok and
                Lalitpur. The on-going projects are: Environment Friendly Integrated Sustainable Agriculture Development
                Project, Public School Physical Facility Development Project, and Girl Students Scholarship Project.
            </p>
            <p class="py-2"> LGN’s projects are funded by foreign donors, INGOs, and individual donors mainly Japanese.
